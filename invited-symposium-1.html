<h2>
    Neuroethics: When neuroscience meets society
</h2>

<p>
    Advances in neuroscience are set to transform our understanding of human cognition and behaviour. They may change how we think about and treat people with behavioural or psychiatric disorders and challenge societyâ€™s views of decision-making and judgments of moral responsibility. This symposium will cover a selection of these issues currently being examined in Australia:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Will neurobiological explanations of mental illness reduce the stigma of mental illness and improve access to effective medical treatment?
    </li>
    <li>
        How will neuroscience change our judgments of moral or legal responsibility?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will cognitive neuroscience challenge our understanding of fundamental human concepts such as personality, identity and gender?
    </li>
    <li>
        How should society respond to the use of emerging neurotechnologies to modify cognition or predict behaviour?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Format:</b> 15 min talks followed by 30 min discussion.
