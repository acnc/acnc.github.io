    Invited Symposium 4
</h1>

<h2>
    Dynamic functional architectures of the human brain
</h2>

<p>
    Recent advances in neuroimaging have shown that macroscopic functional brain networks reorganize spontaneously and in support of cognitive task demands. Capturing meaningful fluctuations in macroscopic network activity remains, however, a major challenge for modern neuroscience. Likewise, the functional relevance of such fluctuations for adaptive and maladaptive behaviour remains unclear. This symposium will bring together two internationally recognised experts in macroscale connectomics and two talented young researchers. Our speakers will discuss how network dynamics can be measured, linked to fundamental principles of brain function, and associated with behavior. The symposium will also highlight current advances and pitfalls in assessing dynamic changes in brain network activity across time and psychological contexts. Overall, this symposium will provide an introduction to a new paradigm aiming to assess the neural underpinnings of human perceptual and cognitive functions.
