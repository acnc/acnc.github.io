<h1>Invited Symposium 3</h1>

<h2>
    Recent advances in consciousness research
</h2>

<p>
    Consciousness research has recently emerged as a core topic in cognitive neuroscience. Among recent advances, four speakers will present their latest research from both empirical and theoretical studies, from sensory to cognitive processing. The topics include mental imagery, hallucination and dreams, as well as neural correlates of sub-conscious and conscious visual perception, which are investigated with multi-modal methodologies ranging from phenomenology, psychophysics and neuroimaging to computational and theoretical neuroscience. Following the presentations, we will have a panel discussion on recent progress as well as controversies on how to measure subjective consciousness with objective methods.
