<h1>Invited Symposium 2</h1>

<h2>
    NeuroEng: Computational Neuroscience and Neuromorphic Engineering
</h2>

<p>
    NeuroEng is a community and meeting place in Australia for researchers with an active interest in computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering. There is increasingly a great deal of overlap between the cognitive neurosciences and itâ€™s more computational and engineering minded sister disciplines. With an aim to foster greater and more fertile collaborations between ACNS attendees and NeuroEng members this symposium will show case some of the exciting work being undertaken by Australian NeuroEng researchers as well as highlight some of the many ways in which we can collaborate.
