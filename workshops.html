<h2>
    Early Career Researcher (ECR) Workshop
</h2>

<p>
    <b>Thursday 24th November 9:00 am - noon</b>
</p>

<p>
	The ACNS Early Career Researcher Day will take place on Thursday the 24th of November, from 9am to 12:00, with an optional hike around the beautiful Mount Tomaree from 1 to 3pm, and drinks at the Port Stephen Country Club to finish off the day.
</p>

<p>
	The workshop will be focused on the nitty gritty of applying for ECR-related grants, such as the DECRA and NHMRC ECR fellowships, as well as the challenges involved in navigating the early years of one’s career, such as balancing a busy research environment with personal commitments. The morning will feature individual researcher talks as well as a panel discussion. This workshop is ideal for those finishing up their PhDs or in the first few years of their postdoctoral career, but all who identify as early career researchers are welcome to attend. There will be multiple opportunities to network with others in a similar stage of their career, during the morning tea break, hike, or at drinks after the conference opening.
