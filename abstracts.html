<h1>Abstracts</h1>

<h3>
    Submission Deadline: <span style="color: #ee2222;">20 October 2016 midnight (EST)</span>
</h3>

<p>
    ACNS encourages submission of abstracts describing new research on the
    interrelationships between the physiological and psychological aspects of
    behaviour. Abstracts must be written in understandable English and will be
    evaluated on the basis of scientific merit by peer review. Abstracts should
    report original data that will not be published elsewhere prior to the
    meeting, although presentation at a recent meeting (e.g., within a year) of
    another society is acceptable. Submissions should cover primarily methods
    and results, although contributions with a theoretical or methodological
    emphasis are welcome.
</p>

<p>
    Abstracts that are accepted for presentation will be published in the conference proceedings which will be published on the ACNS website. The Scientific Committee reserves the right to make editorial corrections to submitted abstracts.
</p>

<p>
    Please review the submission instructions carefully below.
</p>

<p>
    The presenting author must register and attend ACNS2016. Notification of acceptance will be e-mailed to the designated corresponding author within 2 weeks of submission, to facilitate institutional funding requests. However, the format of the presentation will be notified on November 1, 2016, after abstract submission has closed.
</p>

<p>
    All abstracts must be prepared in plain text, in understandable English with no embedded symbols or formatting characters. Submissions may not include charts, graphs, tables or references.

<p>
    To submit an abstract, the corresponding author must register with the system, with a current email address and setting up a password <a href="http://www.conferenceonline.com/abstract/alogin?clear=1&warehouse_id=1380" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A confirmation email will be sent when you register and also when submitting an abstract. If you do not receive a confirmation email upon submitting your abstract, please contact <a href="mailto:conference@acns.org.au">conference@acns.org.au</a>.

    <li>
        Enter each author and list their primary affiliation/institution. Do not abbreviate the affiliation.
    </li>

        Include full first and last names for each author.
    </li>
    <li>
        The body of the Abstract must not exceed 250 words. It does not have to be organised in sections, but must clearly indicate background, methods, results and touch on discussion.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you wish to provide a funding source for your research, please include it as the last sentence in your abstract.
    </li>
    <li>
        Proofread your submission.
    </li>

        Consider submitting your abstract earlier than the deadline. ACNS welcomes early submissions!

</ul>

<p>
    If you do not receive an e-mail response within 24 hours after submission, ACNS did not receive your abstract. In this case, it is your responsibility to contact <a href="mailto:conference@acns.org.au">conference@acns.org.au</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We encourage new research and preliminary findings. However, we do not support early development of research programs that have no data. If in doubt, please contact <a href="mailto:conference@acns.org.au">conference@acns.org.au</a>. Theoretical papers and systematic reviews can be submitted and will be considered on their merit.
