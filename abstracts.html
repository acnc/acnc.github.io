<h1>Abstracts</h1>

<h3>
    Submission Deadline: <span style="color: #ee2222;">20 October 2016 midnight (EST)</span>
</h3>

<p>
    ACNS encourages submission of abstracts describing new research on the
    interrelationships between the physiological and psychological aspects of
    behaviour. Abstracts must be written in understandable English and will be
    evaluated on the basis of scientific merit by peer review. Abstracts should
    report original data that will not be published elsewhere prior to the
    meeting, although presentation at a recent meeting (e.g., within a year) of
    another society is acceptable. Submissions should cover primarily methods
    and results, although contributions with a theoretical or methodological
    emphasis are welcome.
</p>

<p>
    Abstracts that are accepted for presentation will be published in the conference proceedings which will be published on the ACNS website. The Scientific Committee reserves the right to make editorial corrections to submitted abstracts.
</p>

    <b>Please review the submission instructions carefully below.</b>
</p>
