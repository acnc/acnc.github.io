                Dr Rosalyn Moran,
            </h3>

            <p>
                Rosalyn pioneers 'mathematical microscopes' using dynamic causal modelling and Bayesian statistics to probe how certain chemicals modulate brain connectivity. She employs these methods in empirical neuropharmacological studies to examine their algorithmic role in hierarchical inference under the Free Energy Principle. Rosalyn is a co-author of SPM.

                    The multitasking driver: Why talking to your car will drive you to distraction.

            <p>
                Dr Strayer's research examines how attention functions within multiple research domains, from assessing the limits of human multitasking ability while performing complex tasks such as driving, to studying how attentional capacities can be restored by interacting with nature. He uses converging methodologies to measure changes in both attention and performance, from psychophysiological (EEG and fMRI), subjective ratings, to primary (e.g., driving performance) and secondary task (e.g., reaction time) measures.

            </h3>

            <p>
                Dr Park's research focus is on understanding the neural mechanisms that account for age-related cognitive decline, and determining how enriching and cognitive demanding experiences can facilitate cognitive health, thus delaying brain aging and the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Dr Park has also pioneered research in cultural neuroscience, focusing on understanding how cultural experiences sculpt neural function and behavior in both old and young adults. Dr Park's work is guided by the 'Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition' (Park & Reuter-Lorenz, 2009), an integrative theory of cognitive aging that suggests that the brain sustains a series of neural insults with increasing age. Dr Park directs the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS), a large longitudinal study that uses multimodal imaging (PET, MRI, and fMRI) to examine changes in the structure and function of the brain across the lifespan, mapping the changing neural circuitry associated with cognitive performance across the lifespan.

<h2><a name="equity">Equity Policy Launch</a></h2>

<p>
    ACNS is strongly committed to the promotion of equity in science. The Equity Working Group has developed our Equity and Diversity Policy which will be launched at this yearâ€™s conference.

<h2><a name="poster">Poster Session</a></h2>

<p>
    This year we will have one large poster session. We aim to make this a vibrant and stimulating event. To help lubricate lively conversation, we will have a cash-bar and nibbles available throughout the session.
