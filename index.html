<h1>
    2016 Australasian Cognitive Neuroscience Conference
</h1>

<h2>
    24-27 November 2016
</h2>

<p>
    The 2016 Australasian Cognitive Neuroscience Conference (ACNC) will be
    hosted by the University of Newcastle at Shoal Bay NSW. As usual, the
    conference will open Thursday afternoon with a keynote address and reception
    and close on Sunday afternoon after the AGM and awards. Technical and ECR
    workshops will be organised on Wednesday (23/11) and Thursday.
</p>

<p>
    The conference venue will be the beachfront
    <a href="http://www.ramada.com/hotels/australia/shoal-bay-port-stephens/ramada-resort-shoal-bay/hotel-overview">Ramada Resort at Shoal Bay</a>,
    which includes a range of accommodation options (studio to 3 bed apartments,
    all include kitchen facilities). We are currently negotiating prices to make
    it affordable for delegates to bring the family along and for students to
    have a range of shared accommodation options. A range of other accommodation
    options are also available in close proximity. The conference venue caters
    well to families with young kids, so we are striving to make this a
    family-friendly event.  We are excited to confirm two keynote speakers at
    this point:

    <b>
        <a href="http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/person.php?id=79">Dr David Strayer</a>, Professor of Cognition and Neural Science, University of Utah, USA.
    </b>
    <i>The multitasking driver:  Why talking to your car will drive you to distraction.</i>
</p>

<p>
    Dr Strayer’s research examines how attention functions within multiple
    research domains, from assessing the limits of human multitasking ability
    while performing complex tasks such as driving, to studying how attentional
    capacities can be restored by interacting with nature. He uses converging
    methodologies to measure changes in both attention and performance, from
    psychophysiological (EEG and fMRI), subjective ratings, to primary (e.g.,
    driving performance) and secondary task (e.g., reaction time) measures.

        <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/park.html">Dr Denise C. Park</a>, Director of Research at the Center for Vital Longevity, Distinguished University Chair in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, and Regents’ Research Scholar, University of Texas, Dallas.
    </b>
</p>

<p>
    Dr Park’s research focus is on understanding the neural mechanisms that
    account for age-related cognitive decline, and determining how enriching and
    cognitive demanding experiences can facilitate cognitive health, thus
    delaying brain aging and the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Park has also
    pioneered research in cultural neuroscience, focusing on understanding how
    cultural experiences sculpt neural function and behavior in both old and
    young adults. Dr Park’s work is guided by the ‘Scaffolding Theory of Aging
    and Cognition’ (Park & Reuter-Lorenz, 2009), an integrative theory of
    cognitive aging that suggests that the brain sustains a series of neural
    insults with increasing age. Dr Park directs the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
    (DLBS), a large longitudinal study that uses multimodal imaging (PET, MRI,
    and fMRI) to examine changes in the structure and function of the brain
    across the lifespan, mapping the changing neural circuitry associated with
    cognitive performance across the lifespan.

    Watch this space for technical and scientific workshops, planned for
    Wednesday and Thursday. And please get in touch with us asap, if you would
    like to organise something yourself.
